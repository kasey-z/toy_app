# README

This is a simple scaffolded app on Rails which is the solution for [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/getting-your-feet-wet).

It has been deployed to [Heroku](https://tranquil-brook-79304.herokuapp.com/).

The purpose of making the app is to learn RoR by building and testing this twitter like microblogging application. The knowledge points as below

* Scaffolding automatically creates code to model data and interact with it through the web.

* Scaffolding is good for getting started quickly but is bad for understanding.

* Rails uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for structuring web applications.

* As interpreted by Rails, the REST architecture includes a standard set of URLs and controller actions for interacting with data models.

* Rails supports data validations to place constraints on the values of data model attributes.

* Rails comes with built-in functions for defining associations between different data models.

* We can interact with Rails applications at the command line using the Rails console.
